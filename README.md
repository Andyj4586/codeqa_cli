Trying to build a locally run tool to perform RAG using Ollama to help users ask their model of chocie about repos on their computers.

Got it working but very slow on my computer. Need to fix speed, and also see if there are ways to just update the model with this info...like build the vector
database and just add to Ollama model? Check out the Ollama documentaiton to see what i can do, this would greatly improve speed. 

Also, like the idea of making this a CLI tool, so users can just run the command codeqa index ./repo or codeqa ask "How does this repo work?"
